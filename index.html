<h3>These alignments were created by taking the batter's data from either 2019 or 2019-2020, depending on how much data was available in 2019. Each batter's data was randomly separated into train and test datasets with a 2:1 split. The shift was generated by the train data and evaluated on the test data before and after training.</h3>
